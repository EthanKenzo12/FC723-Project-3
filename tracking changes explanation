The use of git log command to display a list of commits made in the repository
along with relevant information like commit hash, author, date, and commit message.
this will help me keep track of commits that I have made and pushed to the repository.
Git show command displays the changes introduced in a particular commit.
specifying the commit hash or a branch name allows you to view the changes introduced to those branches with the commit
The git diff command shows the differences between two commits,
the working directory, or between the working directory and the staging area.
the function is akin to viewing the history of the particular branch or folder,
allowing you to see and compare the before and after changes interlocutor with a particular commit
lastly, git commit creates a new commit with the changes staged in the staging area.
It opens an editor for you to enter a commit message. opening a commit message serves a similar function to commenting on code
as it details a quick summary of the main changes you have made to the code prior to pushing the commit to origin
